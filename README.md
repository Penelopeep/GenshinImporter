# <center> GenshinImporter </center>
 <center> Plugin that nobody asked for but many of us needed.  <br />
Allows for quickly importing hundreds of your artifacts from official server.</center>

## Usage

1. Get your genshin data from [InventoryKamera](https://github.com/Andrewthe13th/Inventory_Kamera/)
2. Download GenshinImporter from [releases](https://github.com/Penelopeep/GenshinImporter/releases/latest)
3. Launch you server with plugin installed
4. Now open `Grasscutter_Folder/Plugins/CharacterBuilder` and paste your data (with .json extension) from InventoryKamera to this folder. <br>
 I recommend renaming it to something like `data.json` so you can easily type it later.
4. Use command `/import <file name> or !import <file name>` to get list of current available builds (don't add .json extension in command)

## Helping
This plugin is built for InventoryKamera data, but if you have other data source, you can help me by sending me output from other inventory scanner like:<br>
- [AdeptiScanner](https://github.com/D1firehail/AdeptiScanner-GI) (I couldn't get it to work myself).
- [Artiscan](https://artiscan.ninjabay.org/#/) (Manual scanner that requires you to manually add video or images of your inventory).
- Any other scanner that outputs data in (preferably) json format.

## FAQ
1. How to install plugin?
    - Add the newest jar file from [here](https://github.com/Penelopeep/GenshinImporter/releases), and put it in **GrasscutterFolder/Plugins** (make this folder if you don't have)
2. I found a bug, where to report it?
    - Let me know on discord **<a href="https://discord.com/users/276265598508466176">Penelopeep#7963</a>** or make an issue on github
3. Stats aren't matching official server:
    - This plugin is using Snoo's GiveArtifact code, so it might be not 100% accurate, but it's close enough.
4. I have other question:

### Version
This plugin is WIP, I have plans to add more features.
Plugin is built for Grasscutter `1.4.1-dev`. I don't know if it will work on other versions, but it should.
